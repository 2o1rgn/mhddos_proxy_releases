- **18.05.2022**
  - Added `--copies` option in order to run multiple copies (recommended for use with 4+ CPUs and network > 100 Mb / s).
- **15.05.2022**
  - Completely updated, asynchronous version, which ensures maximum efficiency and minimum load on the system
  - Efficient operation with larger values of the `-t` parameter (up to 10k) without the risk of "freezing" the whole system

  - Attack types `RGET`, `RHEAD`, `RHEX` and `STOMP` added
- **23.04.2022** 
  - The `--vpn` option has been changed - now your IP/VPN is being used **together** with the proxy, rather than instead. To restore the previous behavior, use `--vpn 100`
- **20.04.2022**
  - Significantly improved the system resources utilization for the best attack efficiency
  - Added `--udp-threads` option in order to control the intensity of UDP attacks (default 1)

  - In the `--debug` mode, total statistics for all targets have been added
  - More proxy servers have been added
- **13.04.2022** 
  - Added the option to disable targets and add comments to the configuration file; now lines starting with '#' are ignored
  - Fixed an issue of crashing the script after a long run and other bugs while changing loops
  - Fixed color display on Windows terminal (without editing the registry)
  - In case of no targets available, the script will wait, instead of stopping completely
- **09.04.2022** New proxy utilization system; as of now everyone gets ~ 200 proxies to attack from a total pool of 10,000+. The `-p` (` --period`) and `--proxy-timeout` parameters are deprecated

- **01.04.2022** Updated CFB attack method to synchronize with MHDDoS
- **31.03.2022** Added some reliable DNS servers instead of system ones for name resolution (1.1.1.1, 8.8.8.8 etc.)
